Freaky Bob™️! NOT very demure. And I said, “Listen up beta, that wasn’t very skibidi of you, you best freak off before I mog your ass!” He went a-yapping about his edging streak and Kai Cenat channel membership and I was like “that’s cap blud, no one can goon to gyat like me”, when I hung up on the brat and took a sip of my lean. Yeah. This is how sigmas behave 😎\n\n",

        "Holy Hawk Tuah. My last words on this planet were about to be Holy Gyatt. Ok? Because this brainrot vocab has completely integrated, INFUSED in my vocabulary. Because- I can’t even talk normally now. Like I can’t even say “OMG”, I have to say “Oh my Gyatt”. Because- Like.. I’m serious. This stuff- like- I was about to die. and All I could muster out to say was Holy Gyatt. Like, I was rafting, and then the raft was going 100 mph at a rock. And all I could say, All I could- Like… Like, speak was “Holy Gyatt!! Holy Gyatt!!” again and again. While I was like, ramming towards the rock and I said “Holy Gyatt!!” and then my head went under. Like, I went into the river that we were rafting on.. And Imagine if I hit my head on that rock that day, and I wasn’t rescued from the rapids, Okay, Imagine if I just hit my head. My last words would have been “Holy Gyatt”. That would be what was written on my gravestone. It is so over for me. I actually need to fix my vocabulary. And now, like, especially since school has started, I’ve, like, created like, this new word, “Holy Hawk Tuah”, Now, I’m just like, responding to people with “Holy Hawk Tuah”. And surprisingly, some people don’t know what that means, So I’ll be like “Holy Hawk Tuah” and They’ll be like “What are you talking about?” “What is a Holy Hawk Tuah?”. I don’t know, How am I supposed to explain what Hawk Tuah is to you, and I can’t respond to people like that, Like, People will be like “Oh like my situationship isn’t going too well we broke up”, “Holy Hawk Tuah!!” Like- I-It’s over for me, It’s actually over for me.\n\n",
        "To the sigmas of Australia, I say that this goofy ahh government have been capping, not just now but for a long time. A few of you may remember when they said “there’ll be no Fanum Tax under the government I lead”. They’re cappaholics! They’re also yappaholics! They yap non-stop about how their cost of living measures are changing lives for all Australians. Just put the fries in the bag, lil bro. They tell us that they’re “locked in” on improving the housing situation in this country. They must have brainrot from watching too much Kai Cenat and forgot about their plans to ban social media for kids under 14. If that becomes law, you can forgor all about watching Duke Dennis or catching a dub with the bros on Fort. Chat, is this Prime Minister serious? Even though he’s the Prime Minister of Australia, sometimes it feels like he’s the CEO of Ohio! I would be taking an L if I did not mention the opps who want to cut WA’s Gyatts and Services Tax. The decision voters will be making in a few months time will be between a mid government, a dogwater opposition, or a crossbench that will mog both of them. Though some of you cannot yet vote, I hope when you do, it will be in a more goated Australia for a government with more aura. Skibidi!\n\n",
        "one time i did a backflip and i was so angry because i didnt want to do the backflip but i did do backflip because i didnt want to but body did backflip anyways as i was frozen in fear at the giant squid coming towards me and then i was actually like holy crap im a sigma and then the squid like totally wrapped its tentecals around me and stole me away frfr because i was a sigma but then i did backflip without wanting to do a backflip because the squid was coming towards me and i was so scared that i screamed skibidi rizzler delight and then everyone actually started clapping and i was awarded for solving world peace but then the squid took away the medal because my sigma member ship ran out and i was like oh no my sigma member ship. and i was just so sad and angry that i let my sigma member ship expire but then suddenly i did a backflip again and became depressed. but then i was more depressed then the squid so i laughed and everyone clapped and yelled POGGERS and i got a medal for solving world hunger.",

        "I’m extremely tired of these idiots calling skibidi toilet brainrot, like they will use the same statement again and again as an argument, they will attack the community and the creator, like don’t these ratfucks have anything to do other than just hate on something? Oh, you know what? The Amazing Digital Circus is also brainrot right? Sure it is actually for kids, but these grown fetuses thirsting over a fictional clown girl isn’t brainrot but a head coming out of a toilet is? I seriously don’t understand their logic, like they even call it a content farm like… What? There is a huge difference between skibidi toilet and those garbage content farms. Also these haters don’t agree that their memes at their generation were fucking brainrot also, there are haters also who know their memes were brainrot but they think that their memes weren’t better or superior, every meme was cringe at some point and ofcourse there are haters with no brains calling it a meme even tho it’s now a goddamn series, I was arguing with a hater in a gmod post and he said\n\n“skibidi toilet is a meme because it started as a meme”\n\nand I don’t even wanna talk about it. These people call others 9 year old iPad kids. It’s hilarious that idiots like these cry over kids enjoying a series of cameramen,tvmen and speakermen fighting toilet heads to save the world instead of worrying about college,schools,jobs etc. It’s sad that most of the haters don’t even give this series a chance and just judge it by its cover, and there are more immature haters than there are mature fans. Gen z is the actual doomed generation with its immature behaviour and most of the haters are young teens or tweens who think they are superior on the internet by hating on a series which kids enjoy.",

        "Describing 9/11 in terms of Amongus \n\nThe United States had a thriving space station consisting of two main structures; the North Tower and the South Tower, each filled with Crewmates going about their daily tasks. However, a group of Impostors disguised as Crewmates, had infiltrated the station and were plotting to cause chaos.\n\nOn one fateful day, the Impostors hijacked two spacecrafts and piloted them towards the two towers. The Crewmates on the ground watched in horror as the spacecrafts crashed into the towers, causing massive explosions and fires.\n\nThe Crewmates in the towers scrambled to evacuate, but many were trapped as the buildings began to collapse. Emergency Crewmates, including firefighters and medical personnel, rushed to the scene to help their colleagues and put out the fires and complete tasks.\n\nAmong U.S catastrophes, this was the most devastating in history, with thousands of innocent Crewmates losing their lives. The United States vowed to find those responsible for the attack, and to eject them. They issued an emergency meeting and began to track down the Impostors who had carried out the horrific act of violence.",

        "I like to creep around my home and act like a goblin\n\nI don’t know why but I just enjoy doing this. Maybe it’s my way of dealing with stress or something but I just do it about once every week. Generally I’ll carry around a sack and creep around in a sort of crouch-walking position making goblin noises, then I’ll walk around my house and pick up various different “trinkets” and put them in my bag while saying stuff like “I’ll be having that” and laughing maniacally in my goblin voice (“trinkets” can include anything from shit I find on the ground to cutlery or other utensils). The other day I was talking with my neighbours and they mentioned hearing weird noises like what I wrote about and I was just internally screaming the entire conversation. I’m 99% sure they don’t know it’s me but god that 1% chance is seriously weighing on my mind.",
        "Earlier today I was really horny, and I saw what I thought to be a blank DVD. I thought, DVDs have a tight hole, they might feel pretty good. So I put my soft pp into the hole of the DVD, and for a few seconds as I started getting harder, it felt pretty good, but then, once I was fully erect, it started being painful. My pp was stuck in the DVD, and I had to break it in half to get if out. It was then when I flipped the broken DVD over and realized that it was not a blank DVD, but a copy of the Pixar movie Up.. Well guys, guess I fucked up.",

        "So do you guys know those waterslides that you stand in, and then they suddenly drop you straight down onto the water slide? If not, look them up on YouTube, there's nothing like them.\n\nAh yes, the sweet memories of my first time on one of these. I feel that my mental/emotional scars have healed enough to tell this gem.\n\nAt the time my girlfriend, now Fiancée, worked as a photographer for one of those resorts with the indoor and outdoor water parks. One of her perks was that her and a family member/friend could get into the waterpark for free, so one hot summer day she had off and we both decided it'd be fun to go there and cool down for the day.\n\nWhile we were there, I discovered one of there most 'Thrilling' looking waterslides. Basically you stand in this tube, and then the slide operator presses a button and this slide drops you straight down a good 90 FEET, before you actually start going down the water slide. Me, being a thrill seeker, of course had to try it. So I made the great climb up to the top of the slide, stood in line, and finally it was my turn. Once I got in the tube, the operator told me to keep my legs crossed. Now I'm a pretty big heavy guy, so I was like 'That's uncomfortable as fuck, I'm not doing that'. So there I was standing in the tube, having a panic attack from anticipation, with my legs not crossed. The operator finally presses the button, the bottom opens and I fall straight down the water slide. Very quickly I realized why they have you cross your legs. Water shot so far up my ass, so fast, I swear I tasted it in my mouth. My body raced down that slide, as I questioned every life choice that I have ever made.\n\nOnce I made it to the bottom, I sat there for a moment, absolutely violated. I felt like someone in an episode of Law & Order: Special Victims Unit. I built up the courage to finally stand up, and all I could feel was the nice warm stream of water mixed with shit, and maybe a little bit of blood shoot out of my ass faster than the Steamboat Geyser at Yellowstone National Park. I quickly got off the slide and ran to the bathroom, with a trail of shitty water tailing me as the slide operator stared in awe. They had to shut down the slide for the rest of the day :'), but man was my asshole clean after that!\n\nMoral of the story: Keep your damn legs crossed on waterslides.",
        "'touch grass' is not an insult towards gamers, rather it is advice for them. When participating in intense periods of gaming, the human hand has a tendency to get sweaty. The sweat causes the hand to become slick, and it b becomes more difficult to retain a grip on the gamers gaming mouse, thus making it more difficult to perform well in intense gaming moments. By touching grass with the gamers hand, the grass will impart a layer of particulate onto the gamers hand, the particulate can be made of a variety of dusts, dirts and other natural matter. This particulate will then act in a similar form to climbers chalk, absorbing the sweat and drying out the gamers hand. With dry hands, the gamer can now perform to their maximum when gaming. This is why when an enemy or teammate tells you to touch grass, they are simply trying to assist you in performing better."
